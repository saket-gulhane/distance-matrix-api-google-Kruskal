# distance-matrix-api-google-Kruskal
Find minimum cost spanning tree on "n" cities, whose distance is calculated using Google Distance Matrix API.

## Inputs to be provided:  
  1. List of citites.
  2. List of pair of cities, whose edges has to be excluded to find spanning tree.  

## Output:
  1. List of "n-1" edges forming minimum cost spanning tree.
  2. Cost of spanning tree.
  
## Description of python program:


Algorithm to be used: Kruskal algorithm to find minimum cost spanning tree.
