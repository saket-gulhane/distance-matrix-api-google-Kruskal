# distance-matrix-api-google-Kruskal
Find minimum cost spanning tree on "n" cities, whose distance is calculated using Google Distance Matrix API.

## Inputs to be provided:  
  1. List of citites (file: "./inputs/cities.txt).
  2. List of pair of cities, whose edges has to be excluded to find spanning tree (file: "./inputs/remove.txt").
